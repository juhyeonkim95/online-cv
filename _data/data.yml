    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am currently under the master's course at Seoul National University [3D vision lab](http://3d.snu.ac.kr/).
      My main areas of interest are computer graphics (especially real-time rendering and ray tracing), reinforcement learning, and 3D computer vision. 
      Currently I am doing research about efficient path tracing on GPU with reinforcement learning.
